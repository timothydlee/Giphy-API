# Giphy-API
Assignment 6 - Giphy API webapp

This app use a jQuery AJAX call to the giphy API to populate top 10 searches for whatever the user inputs. The user's input is generated into a button, and when that button is clicked, the AJAX makes a call back to the API and I used the response to generate the images.

Clicking the images that are generated will either start or pause the gif.
